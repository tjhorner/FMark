## How to install FMark

With [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) installed, click this attractive install button:

<div style="width: 100%; background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient(#79d858, #569e3d); background-image: background-image: linear-gradient(#79d858, #569e3d); font-size: 3em; text-align: center">INSTALL</div>
